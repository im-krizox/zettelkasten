In the zero conditional we use *if __________(main clause), __________(another clause)*.
We use present simple for the main clause and another clause.

For example:
- *If **you miss classes**, **you lose points***.
- *If **you study hard**, **you get good grades***.
- *If **you boil water**, **it evaporates***.
- *If **people comite a crime**, **they go to jail***.
