## Comentario personal.

“An optimized relational database for querying structural patterns in proteins” presents a valuable approach to improve efficiency in biological data analysis. The implementation of optimization techniques, such as table denormalization and attribute indexing, is an important step in facilitating the identification of structural patterns in proteins. Furthermore, the fact that the system is capable of handling complex data in graphical format demonstrates its versatility and potential in biomolecular research. Such advances in relational databases can have a significant impact on the development of new tools and methods in biotechnology and protein engineering.

I find the idea they had to see and understand from another approach the structure of proteins quite curious.

Since we can see them as a database and understand them from another point of view, and we can even analyze them part by part with ``INSERT`` and ``SELECT``.

In conclusion, the development of a relational database optimized for querying structural patterns in proteins represents a significant advance in the management and analysis of complex biological data. The implementation of techniques such as denormalization and indexing not only improves the efficiency of query resolution, but also facilitates access to crucial information for research in biotechnology and protein engineering. These efforts are essential to foster a deeper understanding of biomolecular functions and to drive the discovery of new proteins, which could have important implications for medicine and biology.
