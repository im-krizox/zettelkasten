## Comentario personal.

The article talks about the company Worldcoin, which from what I have investigated, is dedicated to collect biometric data in exchange for 20 dollars. The company however has not mentioned for what purpose they want this data, they only say that it is to generate a credential for each person in the world, however, I think they have other reasons, in addition, people should be more careful with their data and even more with their biometric data, because in my opinion this is something serious.

I think it is good that this company is subject to an investigation, and if possible that they publicly clarify why they are collecting all this data and give more information about the privacy and security with which they store it.

This is due to the fact that in the past there have been several cases of attacks to databases and later these hackers sell the information to untrustworthy people.
